                    <p>This project focuses on the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process for crowdfunding data. The goal is to design and implement a pipeline that can extract data from various sources (e.g., APIs, databases, files), transform it into a usable format, and load it into a data warehouse or analysis platform. This project demonstrates skills in data engineering, data wrangling, and database management. The resulting data can then be used for further analysis of crowdfunding trends and success factors.</p>
