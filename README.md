### Natural Language Processing
   
- [**Amazon Vine Analysis**](https://github.com/abraham-22/data-science-portfolio/tree/main/Amazon%20Vine%20Analysis)

  - **Overview:** This project analyzes Amazon Vine program data. The Amazon Vine program invites trusted reviewers to post opinions about new and pre-release items. This analysis aims to understand the characteristics of Vine reviews compared to non-Vine reviews. Key objectives include determining if Vine reviews are more helpful, if they tend to have higher ratings, and identifying any potential biases. The project involves data manipulation, statistical testing, and potentially sentiment analysis.
